### Prerequesites

This Guide assumes basic familiarity with StatsForecast. For a minimal
example visit the [Quick Start](./1_Getting_Started_short.ipynb).

</Warning>

Follow this article for a step to step guide on building a
production-ready forecasting pipeline for multiple time series.

During this guide you will gain familiary with the core
[`StatsForecast`](https://Nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/src/core/core.html#statsforecast)class
and some relevant methods like `StatsForecast.plot`,
[`StatsForecast.forecast`](https://Nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/src/core/core.html#statsforecast.forecast)
and `StatsForecast.cross_validation.`

We will use a classical benchmarking dataset from the M4 competition.
The dataset includes time series from different domains like finance,
economy and sales. In this example, we will use a subset of the Hourly
dataset.

We will model each time series individually. Forecasting at this level
is also known as local forecasting. Therefore, you will train a series
of models for every unique series and then select the best one.
StatsForecast focuses on speed, simplicity, and scalability, which makes
it ideal for this task.

**Outline:**

1.  Install packages.
2.  Read the data.
3.  Explore the data.
4.  Train many models for every unique combination of time series.
5.  Evaluate the model’s performance using cross-validation.
6.  Select the best model for every unique time series.

</Tip>

## Install libraries

We assume you have StatsForecast already installed. Check this guide for
instructions on [how to install StatsForecast](./0_Installation.ipynb).

Additionally, we will install `s3fs` to read from the S3 Filesystem of
AWS and `datasetsforecast` for common error metrics like MAE or MASE.

Install the necessary packages using
`pip install statsforecast s3fs datasetsforecast`

## Read the data

We will use pandas to read the M4 Hourly data set stored in a parquet
file for efficiency. You can use ordinary pandas operations to read your
data in other formats likes `.csv`.

The input to StatsForecast is always a data frame in [long
format](https://www.theanalysisfactor.com/wide-and-long-data/) with
three columns: `unique_id`, `ds` and `y`:

-   The `unique_id` (string, int or category) represents an identifier
    for the series.

-   The `ds` (datestamp or int) column should be either an integer
    indexing time or a datestampe ideally like YYYY-MM-DD for a date or
    YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS for a timestamp.

-   The `y` (numeric) represents the measurement we wish to forecast.
    The target column needs to be renamed to `y` if it has a different
    column name.

This data set already satisfies the requirements.

Depending on your internet connection, this step should take around 10
seconds.

```python
import pandas as pd

Y_df = pd.read_parquet('https://datasets-nixtla.s3.amazonaws.com/m4-hourly.parquet')

Y_df.head()
```

|     | unique_id | ds  | y     |
|-----|-----------|-----|-------|
| 0   | H1        | 1   | 605.0 |
| 1   | H1        | 2   | 586.0 |
| 2   | H1        | 3   | 586.0 |
| 3   | H1        | 4   | 559.0 |
| 4   | H1        | 5   | 511.0 |

This dataset contains 414 unique series with 900 observations on
average. For this example and reproducibility’s sake, we will select
only 10 unique IDs and keep only the last week. Depending on your
processing infrastructure feel free to select more or less series.

<Note>

Processing time is dependent on the available computing resources.
Running this example with the complete dataset takes around 10 minutes
in a c5d.24xlarge (96 cores) instance from AWS.

</Note>

```python
uids = Y_df['unique_id'].unique()[:10] # Select 10 ids to make the example faster

Y_df = Y_df.query('unique_id in @uids') 

Y_df = Y_df.groupby('unique_id').tail(7 * 24) #Select last 7 days of data to make example faster
```

## Explore Data with the plot method

Plot some series using the `plot` method from the
[`StatsForecast`](https://Nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/src/core/core.html#statsforecast)
class. This method prints 8 random series from the dataset and is useful
for basic EDA.

<Note>

The `StatsForecast.plot` method uses Plotly as a defaul engine. You can
change to MatPlotLib by setting `engine="matplotlib"`.

</Note>

```python
from statsforecast import StatsForecast

StatsForecast.plot(Y_df)
```

## Train multiple models for many series

StatsForecast can train many models on many time series efficiently.

Start by importing and instantiating the desired models. StatsForecast
offers a wide variety of models grouped in the following categories:

-   **Auto Forecast:** Automatic forecasting tools search for the best
    parameters and select the best possible model for a series of time
    series. These tools are useful for large collections of univariate
    time series. Includes automatic versions of: Arima, ETS, Theta, CES.

-   **Exponential Smoothing:** Uses a weighted average of all past
    observations where the weights decrease exponentially into the past.
    Suitable for data with no clear trend or seasonality. Examples: SES,
    Holt’s Winters, SSO.

-   **Benchmark models:** classical models for establishing baselines.
    Examples: Mean, Naive, Random Walk

-   **Intermittent or Sparse models:** suited for series with very few
    non-zero observations. Examples: CROSTON, ADIDA, IMAPA

-   **Multiple Seasonalities:** suited for signals with more than one
    clear seasonality. Useful for low-frequency data like electricity
    and logs. Examples: MSTL.

-   **Theta Models:** fit two theta lines to a deseasonalized time
    series, using different techniques to obtain and combine the two
    theta lines to produce the final forecasts. Examples: Theta,
    DynamicTheta

Here you can check the complete list of
[models](../../src/core/models.ipynb) .

For this example we will use:

-   [`AutoARIMA`](https://Nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/src/core/models.html#autoarima):
    Automatically selects the best ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated
    Moving Average) model using an information criterion. Ref:
    [`AutoARIMA`](https://Nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/src/core/models.html#autoarima).

-   [`HoltWinters`](https://Nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/src/core/models.html#holtwinters):
    triple exponential smoothing, Holt-Winters’ method is an extension
    of exponential smoothing for series that contain both trend and
    seasonality. Ref:
    [`HoltWinters`](https://Nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/src/core/models.html#holtwinters)

-   [`SeasonalNaive`](https://Nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/src/core/models.html#seasonalnaive):
    Memory Efficient Seasonal Naive predictions. Ref:
    [`SeasonalNaive`](https://Nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/src/core/models.html#seasonalnaive)

-   [`HistoricAverage`](https://Nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/src/core/models.html#historicaverage):
    arthimetic mean. Ref:
    [`HistoricAverage`](https://Nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/src/core/models.html#historicaverage).

-   [`DynamicOptimizedTheta`](https://Nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/src/core/models.html#dynamicoptimizedtheta):
    The theta family of models has been shown to perform well in various
    datasets such as M3. Models the deseasonalized time series. Ref:
    [`DynamicOptimizedTheta`](https://Nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/src/core/models.html#dynamicoptimizedtheta).

Import and instantiate the models. Setting the `season_length` argument
is sometimes tricky. This article on [Seasonal
periods](https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/seasonal-periods/)) by the
master, Rob Hyndmann, can be useful.

```python
from statsforecast.models import (
    AutoARIMA,
    HoltWinters,
    CrostonClassic as Croston, 
    HistoricAverage,
    DynamicOptimizedTheta as DOT,
    SeasonalNaive
)


# Create a list of models and instantiation parameters
models = [
    AutoARIMA(season_length=24),
    HoltWinters(),
    Croston(),
    SeasonalNaive(season_length=24),
    HistoricAverage(),
    DOT(season_length=24)
]
```

We fit the models by instantiating a new
[`StatsForecast`](https://Nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/src/core/core.html#statsforecast)
object with the following parameters:

-   `models`: a list of models. Select the models you want from
    [models](../../src/core/models.ipynb) and import them.

-   `freq`: a string indicating the frequency of the data. (See [pandas
    available
    frequencies](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/timeseries.html#offset-aliases).)

-   `n_jobs`: n_jobs: int, number of jobs used in the parallel
    processing, use -1 for all cores.

-   `fallback_model`: a model to be used if a model fails.

Any settings are passed into the constructor. Then you call its fit
method and pass in the historical data frame.

```python
# Instantiate StatsForecast class as sf
sf = StatsForecast(
    df=Y_df, 
    models=models,
    freq='H', 
    n_jobs=-1,
    fallback_model = SeasonalNaive(season_length=7)
)
```

<Note>

StatsForecast achieves its blazing speed using JIT compiling through
Numba. The first time you call the statsforecast class, the fit method
should take around 5 seconds. The second time -once Numba compiled your
settings- it should take less than 0.2s.

</Note>

The
[`forecast`](https://Nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/src/ets.html#forecast)
method takes two arguments: forecasts next `h` (horizon) and `level`.

-   `h` (int): represents the forecast h steps into the future. In this
    case, 12 months ahead.

-   `level` (list of floats): this optional parameter is used for
    probabilistic forecasting. Set the `level` (or confidence
    percentile) of your prediction interval. For example, `level=[90]`
    means that the model expects the real value to be inside that
    interval 90% of the times.

The forecast object here is a new data frame that includes a column with
the name of the model and the y hat values, as well as columns for the
uncertainty intervals. Depending on your computer, this step should take
around 1min. (If you want to speed things up to a couple of seconds,
remove the AutoModels like ARIMA and Theta)

<Note>

The
[`forecast`](https://Nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/src/ets.html#forecast)
method is compatible with distributed clusters, so it does not store any
model parameters. If you want to store parameters for every model you
can use the `fit` and `predict` methods. However, those methods are not
defined for distrubed engines like Spark, Ray or Dask.

</Note>

```python
forecasts_df = sf.forecast(h=48, level=[90])

forecasts_df.head()
```

Plot the results of 8 random series using the `StatsForecast.plot`
method.

```python
sf.plot(Y_df,forecasts_df)
```

The `StatsForecast.plot` allows for further customization. For example,
plot the results of the different models and unique ids.

```python
# Plot to unique_ids and some selected models
sf.plot(Y_df, forecasts_df, models=["HoltWinters","DynamicOptimizedTheta"], unique_ids=["H10", "H105"], level=[90])
```


```python
# Explore other models 
sf.plot(Y_df, forecasts_df, models=["AutoARIMA"], unique_ids=["H10", "H105"], level=[90])
```

## Evaluate the model’s performance

In previous steps, we’ve taken our historical data to predict the
future. However, to asses its accuracy we would also like to know how
the model would have performed in the past. To assess the accuracy and
robustness of your models on your data perform Cross-Validation.

With time series data, **Cross Validation** is done by defining a
sliding window across the historical data and predicting the period
following it. This form of cross-validation allows us to arrive at a
better estimation of our model’s predictive abilities across a wider
range of temporal instances while also keeping the data in the training
set contiguous as is required by our models.

The following graph depicts such a Cross Validation Strategy:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nixtla/statsforecast/main/nbs/imgs/ChainedWindows.gif)

Cross-validation of time series models is considered a best practice but
most implementations are very slow. The statsforecast library implements
cross-validation as a distributed operation, making the process less
time-consuming to perform. If you have big datasets you can also perform
Cross Validation in a distributed cluster using Ray, Dask or Spark.

In this case, we want to evaluate the performance of each model for the
last 2 days (n_windows=2), forecasting every second day (step_size=48).
Depending on your computer, this step should take around 1 min.

<Tip>

Setting `n_windows=1` mirrors a traditional train-test split with our
historical data serving as the training set and the last 48 hours
serving as the testing set.

</Tip>

The
[`cross_validation`](https://Nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/src/distributed.utils.html#cross_validation)
method from the
[`StatsForecast`](https://Nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/src/core/core.html#statsforecast)
class takes the following arguments.

-   `df`: training data frame

-   `h` (int): represents h steps into the future that are being
    forecasted. In this case, 24 hours ahead.

-   `step_size` (int): step size between each window. In other words:
    how often do you want to run the forecasting processes.

-   `n_windows`(int): number of windows used for cross validation. In
    other words: what number of forecasting processes in the past do you
    want to evaluate.

```python
crossvaldation_df = sf.cross_validation(
    df=Y_df,
    h=24,
    step_size=24,
    n_windows=2
  )
```

The crossvaldation_df object is a new data frame that includes the
following columns:

-   `unique_id` index: (If you dont like working with index just run
    `forecasts_cv_df.resetindex()`)

-   `ds`: datestamp or temporal index

-   `cutoff`: the last datestamp or temporal index for the `n_windows.`
    If `n_windows=1`, then one unique cuttoff value, if `n_windows=2`
    then two unique cutoff values.

-   `y`: true value

-   `"model"`: columns with the model’s name and fitted value.

```python
crossvaldation_df.head()
```

|           | ds  | cutoff | y     | AutoARIMA  | HoltWinters | CrostonClassic | SeasonalNaive | HistoricAverage | DynamicOptimizedTheta |
|-----------|-----|--------|-------|------------|-------------|----------------|---------------|-----------------|-----------------------|
| unique_id |     |        |       |            |             |                |               |                 |                       |
| H1        | 701 | 700    | 619.0 | 603.925415 | 847.0       | 742.668762     | 691.0         | 661.674988      | 612.767517            |
| H1        | 702 | 700    | 565.0 | 507.591736 | 820.0       | 742.668762     | 618.0         | 661.674988      | 536.846252            |
| H1        | 703 | 700    | 532.0 | 481.281677 | 790.0       | 742.668762     | 563.0         | 661.674988      | 497.824280            |
| H1        | 704 | 700    | 495.0 | 444.410248 | 784.0       | 742.668762     | 529.0         | 661.674988      | 464.723236            |
| H1        | 705 | 700    | 481.0 | 421.168762 | 752.0       | 742.668762     | 504.0         | 661.674988      | 440.972351            |

Next, we will evaluate the performance of every model for every series
using common error metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Mean Square
Error (MSE) Define a utility function to evaluate different error
metrics for the cross validation data frame.

First import the desired error metrics from `datasetsforecast.losses`.
Then define a utility function that takes a cross-validation data frame
as a metric and returns an evaluation data frame with the average of the
error metric for every unique id and fitted model and all cutoffs.

```python
from datasetsforecast.losses import mse, mae, rmse


def evaluate_cross_validation(df, metric):
    models = df.drop(columns=['ds', 'cutoff', 'y']).columns.tolist()
    evals = []
    for model in models:
        eval_ = df.groupby(['unique_id', 'cutoff']).apply(lambda x: metric(x['y'].values, x[model].values)).to_frame() # Calculate loss for every unique_id, model and cutoff.
        eval_.columns = [model]
        evals.append(eval_)
    evals = pd.concat(evals, axis=1)
    evals = evals.groupby(['unique_id']).mean(numeric_only=True) # Averages the error metrics for all cutoffs for every combination of model and unique_id
    evals['best_model'] = evals.idxmin(axis=1)
    return evals
```

<Warning>

You can also use Mean Average Percentage Error (MAPE), however for
granular forecasts, MAPE values are extremely [hard to
judge](https://blog.blueyonder.com/mean-absolute-percentage-error-mape-has-served-its-duty-and-should-now-retire/)
and not useful to assess forecasting quality.

</Warning>

Create the data frame with the results of the evaluation of your
cross-validation data frame using a Mean Squared Error metric.

```python
evaluation_df = evaluate_cross_validation(crossvaldation_df, mse)

evaluation_df.head()
```

Create a summary table with a model column and the number of series
where that model performs best. In this case, the Arima and Seasonal
Naive are the best models for 10 series and the Theta model should be
used for two.

```python
summary_df = evaluation_df.groupby('best_model').size().sort_values().to_frame()

summary_df.reset_index().columns = ["Model", "Nr. of unique_ids"]
```

You can further explore your results by plotting the unique_ids where a
specific model wins.

```python
seasonal_ids = evaluation_df.query('best_model == "SeasonalNaive"').index

sf.plot(Y_df,forecasts_df, unique_ids=seasonal_ids, models=["SeasonalNaive","DynamicOptimizedTheta"])
```

## Select the best model for every unique series

Define a utility function that takes your forecast’s data frame with the
predictions and the evaluation data frame and returns a data frame with
the best possible forecast for every unique_id.

```python
def get_best_model_forecast(forecasts_df, evaluation_df):
    df = forecasts_df.set_index('ds', append=True).stack().to_frame().reset_index(level=2) # Wide to long 
    df.columns = ['model', 'best_model_forecast'] 
    df = df.join(evaluation_df[['best_model']])
    df = df.query('model.str.replace("-lo-90|-hi-90", "", regex=True) == best_model').copy()
    df.loc[:, 'model'] = [model.replace(bm, 'best_model') for model, bm in zip(df['model'], df['best_model'])]
    df = df.drop(columns='best_model').set_index('model', append=True).unstack()
    df.columns = df.columns.droplevel()
    df = df.reset_index(level=1)
    return df
```

Create your production-ready data frame with the best forecast for every
unique_id.

```python
prod_forecasts_df = get_best_model_forecast(forecasts_df, evaluation_df)

prod_forecasts_df.head()
```

| model     | ds  | best_model | best_model-hi-90 | best_model-lo-90 |
|-----------|-----|------------|------------------|------------------|
| unique_id |     |            |                  |                  |
| H1        | 749 | 592.701843 | 611.652649       | 577.677307       |
| H1        | 750 | 525.589111 | 546.621826       | 505.449738       |
| H1        | 751 | 489.251801 | 512.424133       | 462.072876       |

| H1        | 753 | 436.290527 | 461.815948       | 411.051239       |

Plot the results.

```python
sf.plot(Y_df, prod_forecasts_df, level=[90])
```
